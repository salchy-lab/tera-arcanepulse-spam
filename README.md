To enable/disable the mod, type salchy in proxy chat.
It's enabled by default and will only work while you're logged into a sorc.
Don't use it with skill-prediction, ngsp or bern or else you will insta dc.

Instructions: just use fireball skill and arcane pulse spam party will begin ;)
To enable/disable "invincible" mode, use a minor replenishment potable (the cheapest mana pot from mechant), and u'll be able to afk while dpsing any boss :P 
If you dc while spamming arcane pulse, your internet is shit and can't handle a 30ms spam. You can change the value, just check the code.
